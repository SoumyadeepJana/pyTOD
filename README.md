#AI plays TotalOverdose

This project aimed to automate the vehicle driving process of my favorite game Total Overdose. This was done using an end to end CNN model and training approach. Due to lack of datasets, a custom dataset was created from the gameplay of about 2 hours. The model developed could effectively understand the game terrain and drove the car quite satisfactorily.
